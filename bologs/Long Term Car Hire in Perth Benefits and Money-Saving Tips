Benefits of Long-Term Car Hire in Perth
Long-term car rentals come with several advantages that make them appealing for extended stays. Cost savings are a major benefit – rental companies typically offer discounted rates when you book for longer periods, meaning you pay much less per day than you would for a short-term hire. 
For example, a monthly rate might work out to be 30–50% cheaper per day than a standard daily rate – huge savings over a few weeks.
Another key benefit of extended rentals is convenience and flexibility. With a long-term hire, you don't need to keep returning to the rental office or renewing contracts every few days. 
One booking covers your entire period, sparing you the hassle of renewing contracts or swapping cars. You'll have the same vehicle throughout your stay, which means no interruptions to your travel routine.
Long-term car hire also frees you from maintenance and repair worries. Rental companies handle all the routine servicing, oil changes, and any unexpected repairs that pop up during your rental period. You won't have to budget extra for vehicle upkeep – it's all part of the service.
Furthermore, most long-term rentals include comprehensive coverage and support as part of the package. It's common for extended car hire agreements to come with basic insurance coverage and 24/7 roadside assistance. That means if you have a flat tire on a weekend road trip or need help, support is just a phone call away. This gives you extra peace of mind during your travels.
Finally, long-term rentals offer predictable costs – you typically pay a fixed rate (monthly or weekly) with no surprise fees, making it easier to budget. And when your stay is over, you simply return the vehicle without any of the hassles of ownership. 
All these extended car hire benefits make long-term rental a hassle-free alternative to frequently renting or even buying a car for a temporary stay in Perth.
Weekly vs Daily Car Hire: Which Saves More?
One common question is whether it's cheaper to rent week-by-week instead of day-by-day. In almost every case, weekly vs daily car hire comes out in favor of the longer rental. Car hire companies reward longer bookings with lower rates. You might find that renting a car for 7 days costs about the same as renting it for 5 individual days – companies often give you two extra days for free. Generally, if you know you need a car for more than a few days, it's more cost-effective to book a week at once than to string together several short rentals.
The longer you rent, the more pronounced the daily rate reduction tends to be. Rental agencies in Perth often have specific price breaks at the 7-day mark and again at the monthly mark. By taking advantage of a weekly rental, you not only save money but also avoid the inconvenience of constantly returning and re-booking the car. With a weekly hire, you keep the same vehicle all week without interruption.
Another factor is peace of mind. With a weekly (or longer) rental, you lock in your vehicle and rate, and you don't have to worry about cars being sold out on the days you need one. You have continuous access to your car, so there's no gap in your mobility. 
Especially during peak tourist seasons in Perth, it can be risky to rely on day-to-day rentals – you might find nothing available last minute. Weekly rentals ensure you’re covered for that entire span. In summary, when comparing weekly vs daily car hire, the weekly option almost always offers the better deal if you need a car for more than a few days.
Weekly or Monthly Car Rental in Perth – Choosing the Right Plan
If you're staying even longer, you might wonder whether to book back-to-back weekly rentals or go for a monthly plan. The rule of thumb is: if your visit extends beyond a couple of weeks, a monthly car rental Perth package will likely offer the best value. Weekly or monthly car rentals both come with discounts, but monthly rates usually provide the deepest cuts on the per-day cost. Rental companies often have special long-term packages for 4 weeks (28 days) or more.
Choosing between weekly and monthly really depends on your schedule. If you're in Perth for, say, 3 or 4 weeks, it's worth comparing the price of a 1-month rental against the cost of renting week-by-week. In many cases, committing to a full month can save you more. Also, monthly rentals can give you extra flexibility – many companies make it easy to extend your rental or adjust the vehicle if your plans change.
If you're unsure about your exact plans, you might start with a weekly rental and then extend it as needed. Just keep in mind that extending a weekly rental piecemeal can end up more expensive than booking the longer term upfront. It’s a good idea to speak with the rental company about your expected timeframe – they might offer a long term car rental deal or a custom rate for your situation. 
The bottom line is that for stays of a month or more, go for the monthly rental; for anything longer than a week (but shorter than a month), compare both options to see which saves more. In summary, weekly or monthly car rentals offer far better value than daily hires, so either choice will save you money.
Money-Saving Tips for Long-Term Car Rentals
Long-term car hire is already budget-friendly, but you can stretch your dollars even further with a few smart strategies:
1. Compare companies and look for local deals: 
Prices can vary between rental providers in Perth. It's wise to shop around and see who offers the best long-term rates. Smaller local companies (like TAK8 Car Rental) often have very competitive long-term rates, so don't just check the big international brands. 
Don't hesitate to mention you're looking for a long-term hire – many companies have special rates or will negotiate a deal for an extended booking.
2. Book for slightly longer to hit discount thresholds: 
Rental pricing often works in tiers. For example, a 25-day hire might actually cost more than a 28-day (one month) hire if the company’s best rate kicks in at the 4-week mark. Similarly, renting for 6 days might cost almost as much as 7 days. 
It can be more economical to round up your rental period to a weekly or monthly package if you're near a pricing threshold. Check prices for a few different durations – sometimes adding an extra day or two can actually reduce the total cost due to these pricing tiers.
3. Avoid airport pick-ups if possible 
Picking up a car directly at Perth Airport usually comes with extra surcharges and higher base rates. If you're looking to save money and you don't need a car immediately upon landing, consider taking a shuttle or taxi into the city and renting from a downtown or suburban location like East Perth. 
Off-airport rentals often have lower fees, and companies like TAK8 Car Rental in the city center offer the same wide vehicle selection without the airport premiums.
4. Choose the right fuel and mileage options
For extended rentals, fuel usage and mileage can impact your budget. Opt for a fuel policy that works for you – "full-to-full" (return with a full tank) is usually best. Plan to fill up at local petrol stations where prices are cheaper, not near the airport. 
Also, be mindful of the mileage terms. Many long-term hires come with unlimited kilometers, but some have caps (for example, 100 km per day) and will charge for excess mileage. If you plan to do a lot of driving around Western Australia, ensure your plan includes unlimited km or a high enough limit to cover your adventures. 
Paying a bit extra for unlimited mileage up front can be far cheaper than racking up per-kilometer fees later.
Exploring Western Australia: Mini Road Trips from Perth
With a long-term rental car, you have the freedom to explore beyond the city whenever you like. For example, popular 1 day trips from Perth include visiting the Pinnacles Desert up north or enjoying a wine tour in the Swan Valley. On a 2 day trip from Perth, you might drive down to Margaret River or head east to see Wave Rock. 
Give yourself 3 day trips from Perth and you can venture even farther – perhaps a loop to Albany in the south. The possibilities for a mini road trip Perth experience are endless, and your long-term hire car means you can embark on these adventures whenever the travel bug bites. (Remember to follow basic driving tips in Perth – stick to the left side, obey speed limits, and stay alert for wildlife on country roads.)

In Perth, any rental around a month or more is generally considered a long-term rental. Most companies define long-term car hire as any booking roughly 4 weeks or longer.

Renters typically must be above a minimum age – usually 21 or 25 years old with a full license. You'll also need a credit card in the driver's name for the security bond and payment, and some form of photo ID (like a passport or Australian ID) for verification.

It varies by company. Many long-term rentals include unlimited kilometers, but some may come with a cap – always check your agreement. If you plan to drive very far, it’s best to choose a deal with unlimited km to avoid any extra fees.
