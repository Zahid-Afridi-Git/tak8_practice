Ready to escape the city? Let’s go.
1. Rottnest Island – Quokkas & Beaches
Distance/Time: Drive ~30 minutes to Fremantle or Hillarys Boat Harbour, then a 90 minute ferry.
Rottnest Island (Wadjemup) is a must see island getaway. It’s famous for its friendly quokkas – the “world’s happiest” little marsupials. Rent a Tak8 car, drive to the ferry terminal (parking available), and hop on a morning ferry. 
Once on Rottnest, cars aren’t allowed, but bicycles are plentiful, hop on a bike and explore miles of coast. Highlights include meeting quokkas on Pinky or The Basin beaches (perfect for selfies), snorkeling in the clear waters off the sand, and chilling on the white sand shores. Other top things to do include:
Cycle the Island: Rent a bike and ride the 24 km loop, stopping at scenic bays.


See the Quokkas: Head to The Basin or Bathurst Lighthouse to spot and photograph these tame, smiling critters.


Beach and Snorkel: Swim or snorkel at crystal clear spots like Little Parakeet Bay.


Historic Sites: Visit Oliver Hill’s tunnel and old radar station for ocean views.


With a day on Rotto, you’ll enjoy animal encounters and beach fun. Tak8 car rental clear, cheap car rental Perth rates mean you get to the ferry without sticker shock.
2. The Pinnacles Desert – Ancient Sandstone Spires
Distance/Time: About 250 km north of Perth (roughly a 2–3 hour drive).
Heading north along Indian Ocean Drive brings you to Nambung National Park, home to the eerie Pinnacles Desert. These limestone pillars, some as tall as 5 meters, rise from golden sands and make an otherworldly scene. The Pinnacles Loop (4 km by gravel road) is easy to drive through, so your Tak8 car rental can take you right into the park.
What to expect: As you drive in the early morning or late afternoon, the low sun casts long shadows between the stone “trees,” creating vivid colors and dramatic photos. You may even glimpse wild emus roaming the dunes. 
In spring, the surrounding scrub bursts with wildflowers, adding splashes of color to the landscape. At the park entrance, learn about the mysterious origins of the pinnacles. If time allows, detour to the nearby Lobster Shack in Cervantes for lunch (fresh seafood!).
The Pinnacles trip is a classic Perth road trip itinerary stop: scenic ocean drives, red sand, and history. It’s an easy 1 day loop, but you could stretch it into a 2day trip by camping or staying in Cervantes. 
Thanks to Tak8’s flexible weekly vs daily car hire deals, you can book just one day or a longer rental if you plan to explore more of the Coral Coast.
“The Pinnacles … are near Cervantes. … thousands of striking limestone pillars set against shifting golden sands. … visit at dawn to see the shadows cast by the unusual formations.”
3. Swan Valley & Caversham Wildlife Park – Wine & Wildlife
Distance/Time: Only 25 minutes northeast of central Perth.
A short drive brings you to the Swan Valley, Western Australia’s oldest wine region. This is a perfect spot for things to do in Perth with a car. With your Tak8 rental, spend the day hopping between tasting rooms and attractions:
Wineries and Breweries: Sample award winning chenin blanc, verdelho, Shiraz and more at boutique wineries like Lancaster and Sandalford. The valley also has craft breweries and distilleries try a local ginger beer or pavlova flavoured vodka!


Gourmet Foods: Indulge in local cheeses, chocolates and jam tasting. (Many cellar doors offer platters or pairings.)


Caversham Wildlife Park: A fun detour is Caversham Park at the end of the valley. Here you can hand feed kangaroos, cuddle a koala and see wombats up close.


Scenic Drives: The roads here are gentle, lined with vines and big sky views and ideal for an easy mini road trip Perth vibe.


Whether you pick a compact Tak8 car to weave between wineries or a spacious SUV for extra comfort, you’ll find budget car rental deals to fit. Tak8 often has a special for multi day stays, so you could turn Swan Valley into a two day trip with a night in a local guesthouse. 
The low cost (per Kayak, Perth rentals can start around $34/day) keeps it friendly on the wallet, letting you savor every sip and view.
“Swan Valley is Western Australia’s oldest winemaking region… Explore the valley’s wineries, renowned for world class chenin blanc, verdelho, shiraz… The valley is also home to microbreweries… Before you head back to Perth, visit Caversham Wildlife Park to meet kangaroos, wombats, koalas and echidnas.”
4. Fremantle – Craft Beer, Markets & Maritime History
Distance/Time: ~20 km southwest of Perth (about a 30 minute drive).
Fremantle (or “Freo”) is Perth’s lively port city at the mouth of the Swan River. With your rental car, it’s an easy day trip that feels like a minotaur of urban cool meets seaside charm. Park in Fremantle and soak up:
Craft Breweries: Fremantle is famed for its beer scene. Visit the original Little Creatures brewery or the historic Sail & Anchor pub for locally brewed ales and ciders.


Al Fresco Dining: South Terrace (“Cappuccino Strip”) offers cafes and restaurants under sunny verandas. Grab fish & chips by the harbor or dine on fresh oysters at the Fishing Boat Harbour.


Fremantle Markets: Open Fri–Sun, this covered bazaar sells local crafts, fashion, produce and street food. It’s a cultural hotspot perfect for browsing and snacking.


History & Sites: Check out the 19th century Round House (Perth’s oldest public building), or explore maritime history at the WA Maritime Museum (with the Australia II yacht).


Fremantle’s walkable streets and harbor views make it a relaxing escape, yet it’s only a hop from the city by Tak8 cars. 
And if you have extra time, swing by nearby Cottesloe Beach for a sunset dip before heading home. With flexible daily or hourly rates, Tak8 makes this 1 day trip from Perth effortless and affordable.
“Fremantle, on Perth’s southern fringes, is a vibrant waterfront city with great beers, al fresco food and intriguing history… Try the craft brews on tap at the landmark heritage pub brewery, The Sail & Anchor… or stop into Fremantle’s local brewery, Little Creatures… you’ll also find the Fremantle Markets… open Friday to Sunday.”
5. Mandurah – Dolphins & Public Art
Distance/Time: About 75 km south of Perth (roughly a 1 hour freeway drive).
Mandurah is famous for its waterways, outdoor art and sealife cruises. It’s well worth the easy drive down the Kwinana Freeway. Top activities for your day trip include:
Dolphin Cruises: Mandurah’s canals and bay are home to wild bottlenose dolphins. Take a morning Giants and Dolphins cruise or SeaLinks tour to see these playful creatures up close.


Public Art: Stroll the Mandurah foreshore to spot giant sculptures by artist Thomas Dambo (whimsical driftwood creations like a giant girl and dog). The waterfront also has boardwalk cafés and shops.


Pelican Watching: Pelicans gather around the bridge at Dolphin Quay – feed them from the pier or enjoy fresh prawns at the seafood stalls.


Local Culture: For a dose of Noongar heritage, join a Mandurah Dreaming tour or visit the local museum.


Tak8’s reliable car rental ensures you get there and back safely. The cruise and art make Mandurah more than “just another boat ride” – it’s a mini seaside resort vibe. You could make it a 2day trip from Perth by staying overnight (the town has many hotels and restaurants) and return refreshed the next morning.
“Mandurah is well worth the cruisy one hour drive from Perth. Embark on a Giants and Dolphins sightseeing cruise to spot the region’s iconic sculptures and cheeky marine life… or join a cultural tour… to delve into the region’s unique ecology and rich Bindjareb Noongar culture.”
Tips for Driving in Perth and Saving on Rentals
Fuel Up Early: Western Australia is vast. Before leaving Perth, fill the tank. Outside the metro area, gas stations can be scarce, so start trips full.


Drive on the Left: In Australia you drive on the left side of the road. Take it slow at first – just follow the flow of traffic. Speed cameras are common, so stick to posted limits.


Plan Your Timing: Avoid Perth’s rush hours (roughly 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM) when possible. Midday drives to places like Cervantes (2+ hours away) will be less stressful. (Kayak notes Pinnacles is about a 2 hour drive north.)


Rent the Right Duration: Compare weekly vs daily car hire rates. For example, a 7 day booking often has a lower daily rate than booking 7 separate days. Tak8 offers special longterm deals – monthly car rental Perth rates can be significantly cheaper per day if you’re on an extended trip.


Choose the Right Car: Narrow city streets and limited parking make a compact car a smart choice. But if you plan offroad or need luggage space, consider a midsize or SUV. Tak8’s fleet has everything from small hatchbacks to roomy 4WDs.


Find the Best Deal: 25% of renters in Perth found cars for about $34 per day or less in recent searches. To get cheap one way rates or special discounts, book online in advance or ask Tak8 about promotions. Sometimes one way rentals have drop fees; going roundtrip or waiting for a special can save $$.


By following these Perth travel tips, your road trips will be smooth and stress free. With Tak8’s reliable service and transparent pricing, you can focus on the fun parts of your journey.

FAQs
How can I get cheap one way car rentals?
One Way rentals (dropping the car in a different city) often come with extra fees. To save money, book well in advance and compare deals on aggregator sites. Sometimes local companies like Tak8 waive one way fees if you rent for longer or pick specific routes. Also, consider returning to the pickup city for a roundtrip rate if one way surcharges are high.
How much does a rental car cost in Perth?
Prices vary by season, car type and length of rental. On average, Perth rentals cost around A$40–$50 per day, but you can find deals from as low as $25–$30 per day. Compact cars are cheapest. Weekly or monthly hires will lower the daily cost. (Tak8 often advertises rates in this range for budget models.)
What is the best company for renting a car in Perth?
There’s no single “best” company for everyone. Major brands (Avis, Budget, Hertz, etc.) have widespread networks, but local specialists like Tak8 can offer personalized service, competitive prices and transparent fees. Read recent customer reviews and compare terms. Tak8 stands out for affordable budget car rental and no hidden charges, making it a smart choice for many travelers.
Can you rent a car long term in Australia?
Yes, long term rentals (weeks to months) are available. Most agencies, including Tak8, offer discounted long term car hire rates for extended bookings. You can often upgrade to a monthly or weekly plan to lower the daily rate. Just check the contract terms (some long leases may require you to take care of routine maintenance or limit extra driver options).
Should I book my car weekly or daily?
If you plan to drive more than a few days, booking weekly almost always saves money on the per day rate. For very short stays (1–2 days), a daily booking might be easiest. For example, a 7 day rental might cost less per day than seven one day rentals. Tak8’s rates reflect this: asking for a weekly quote (or monthly for longer travel) will usually give you a better deal than consecutive daily rates.
