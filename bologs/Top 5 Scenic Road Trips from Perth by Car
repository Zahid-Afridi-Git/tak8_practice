Top 5 Scenic Road Trips from Perth by Car
Dreaming of a getaway beyond the usual tourist traps? You’re not alone. For thousands of travellers arriving in Western Australia, the desire to experience the raw, untouched beauty of the landscape is often met with one problem: limited public transport and scattered, remote destinations. That’s exactly why more and more visitors are turning to self-drive holidays and searching for the best road trips from Perth.
If you’re planning to explore this vast, awe-inspiring region, there’s no better way to do it than behind the wheel of your own car. Whether you're after pristine coastlines, rare wildflowers, or remote red-earthed gorges, the flexibility of having a rental car gives you the freedom to move at your own pace. And for those of you navigating multi-day road trips in Western Australia, it’s not just about convenience, it’s about unlocking hidden landscapes that tour buses simply can't reach.
That’s where we come in. At Tak8 car rental, we specialize in long-term car rental in Perth for explorers like you. From 1-day trips from Perth to 3-day road trips, or even month-long adventures across the state, our flexible options,including weekly vs daily car hire — are built with your journey in mind. In this guide, we’ll walk you through five unforgettable scenic drives from Perth WA that’ll make you want to hit the road and never look back.
So buckle up. Let’s drive into the heart of Western Australia.
1. Perth to Margaret River – Wine, Waves, and Forests (3 Days Minimum)
Ask any local where to begin your Western Australia adventure, and they’ll likely say “Margaret River.” This world-renowned region lies just 270 km south of Perth and offers everything from award-winning wineries to towering karri forests and unspoiled beaches.
Your Perth to Margaret River route is more than just a drive — it’s a curated experience. Picture this: you leave the city in the morning, stop at Busselton Jetty for a coffee and oceanside walk, grab lunch in Dunsborough, and by afternoon, you’re sipping shiraz under the vines.
During spring, wildflowers bloom along Caves Road, transforming your car windows into living postcards. And if you're traveling in whale season (June to November), stop at Surfer’s Point for a glimpse of humpbacks dancing in the distance.
Alex and Jess, a couple from the UK, rented a compact car from Tak8 for 5 days. “We were going to do a day trip,” Alex said. “But once we saw how much there was to do — wineries, caves, hikes, we just extended our car rental to a weekly package. Tak8 made that change super easy.”
Tip: Rent an SUV with extra boot space. Wine crates, surfboards, or even a week’s worth of groceries, you’ll thank us later.
2. Perth to Esperance – White Sands and Pink Lakes (7–10 Days)
If you’ve seen the viral photos of kangaroos lounging on white-sand beaches, you’ve seen Esperance. But what most people don’t realize is that getting there is half the magic. The Perth to Esperance drive, roughly 700km one-way, passes through surreal landscapes: the golden fields of the Wheatbelt, the bizarre wave-shaped rock formations of Hyden, and finally, the radiant coastline of Cape Le Grand National Park.
Highlights include:
Wave Rock in Hyden


Fitzgerald River National Park for its wildflowers


Lucky Bay for beachside kangaroos


Lake Hillier for its cotton-candy pink hue (scenic flights available)


For those interested in monthly car rental in Perth, this route is perfect for slow travel. Stop in small towns, support local cafés, and soak in the land’s rhythm.
Maria, a solo traveller from Singapore, said: “Without Tak8 car rental, I wouldn't have reached Esperance. I got a small 4WD for two weeks and took my time. I saw whales, slept under stars, and used the same car to explore Kalgoorlie on the way back.”
3. Coral Coast Drive (Perth to Exmouth) – Reef, Desert, and Dolphins (10–14 Days)
The Coral Coast is often called the “ultimate marine road trip.” It stretches over 1,200km from Perth to Exmouth, passing jaw-dropping coastal icons like the Pinnacles Desert, Shark Bay, Hutt Lagoon (Pink Lake), and Ningaloo Reef, one of the few places on earth where you can swim with whale sharks right off the beach.
Starting with the lunar landscape of the Pinnacles in Nambung National Park, this trip is ideal for nature lovers and underwater explorers. Make stops in Kalbarri for gorges, in Geraldton for beach cafes, and finally in Exmouth for diving and snorkeling.
This is one of the best multi-day road trips in Western Australia if you’re chasing natural diversity, deserts, reefs, dolphins, and dunes, all in one itinerary.

“I rented a van from Tak8 car rental for two weeks and used it like a mobile base,” said Kevin, a nature photographer from Melbourne. “The long-term rate saved me a fortune compared to daily hire.”
Choose a reliable vehicle with cruise control and a USB port. This is a long drive, and podcasts will be your best friends.
4. Perth to Albany – A Heritage Trail Through Forests and Cliffs (4–5 Days)
For a shorter but still deeply fulfilling journey, the Perth to Albany route combines coastal views with rich Aboriginal and colonial heritage. This 420 km drive is ideal if you're looking for a 2 day trip from Perth, or better yet, stretch it to 4 days for more exploration.
Start in Fremantle, then roll through the wineries of Mount Barker, the treetop walk at the Valley of the Giants, and the dramatic cliffs of The Gap in Albany. This region offers cooler climates, making it ideal for winter travel.
If you’re traveling with family or planning a mini road trip from Perth, Albany is the perfect blend of adventure and relaxation.
Sophie, a local from Perth, used Tak8 for a weekly car hire to show visiting family around. “We drove down to Albany, then looped back through Denmark and Walpole. It was scenic and stress-free because we didn’t have to worry about car reliability.”
Add a child seat or roof rack to your rental during checkout, Tak8 car rental offers add-ons tailored to your trip type.
5. Perth to Kalbarri – Gorges, Skywalks, and Wildflowers (3–4 Days)
The Perth to Kalbarri route is one of the most underrated scenic drives Perth WA has to offer. Just 575 km from the city, Kalbarri offers a striking contrast of coastal cliffs and inland canyons, especially from the elevated Kalbarri Skywalk.
In spring (August to October), this area explodes with wildflowers. Stop in Geraldton along the way for lunch, and don’t miss the photo opportunity at Hutt Lagoon, the shimmering pink lake that changes colour based on sunlight and salinity.
This is a fantastic option for those wanting to experience rugged landscapes without committing to ultra-long distances.
“We booked a 3-day road trip from Perth to Kalbarri with Tak8 car rental sedan class. The car was fuel-efficient and comfortable for the winding roads,” said Ethan, a backpacker from Germany. “It made every stop feel like an intentional detour.”
