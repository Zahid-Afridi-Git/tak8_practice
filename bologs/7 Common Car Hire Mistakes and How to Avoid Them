The best way to explore Perth, Australia is by self-driving a rented car. With a rental car, you are able to take scenic drives through the Swan Valley wine region and visit stunning beaches like Cottesloe. But most of the visitors are making mistakes while they are going to hire a car. Traveling offers so much convenience when self-driving, but many tourists run into problems with their rental cars because of simple mistakes.  
If it is your first time renting a car in Perth, this guide will inspire you while helping you avoid trouble throughout your journey. The tips highlighted in this article are aimed specifically toward beginners and explain what not to do with car rentals. 
Following these seven tips will allow you to secure an affordable deal for your desired vehicle and truly enjoy your road trip without worrying about the details throughout the trip.
1. Last Minute Reservations and Their Costs
Is it advisable to book a rental car at the last minute? Generally, no. As an example, car rentals booked at the last moment are usually priced higher and offer less selection compared to those rented earlier, you either have too few or overpriced options that do not meet your needs. 
This scenario is greatly exacerbated during peak demand times such as holidays and weekends in Perth. You may pay premium rates masquerading as “luxury rate” for economy cars or worse yet, none available when you “need” them the most.
Always plan ahead to avoid these mistakes- for example pre-purchasing your Perth car hire immediately after discovering your travel dates. Early purchasing often not only ensures a great discount (at times saving more than 20%) but also provides time to compare various companies resulting in customized reservations including extras such as GPS navigation or child seats without the stress of last minute arrangements. 
In summary, if your goal is budget car rentals then booking way early will guarantee not just best price but unmatched selection coupled with flexible terms for changing reservations.

2. Failing to Inspect the Vehicle in Detail  

Should you inspect the rental car before leaving? Yes, every single time. One of the most expensive blunders that can be made while renting a vehicle is neglecting to check for damage that existed prior to its use. 
If you forgo inspection and accompanying documentation, you stand to be arbitrarily accounted as responsible (and charged) for damages which are not your doing and had previously existed. Envision returning the vehicle only to incur charges for damage fees for a dent caused by someone else – this happens too often to renters who did not carry out comprehensive checks.
Before driving off, here is a checklist that will ensure further processes go smoothly alongside a few minutes dedicated:    
Conduct exterior assessment: Scratches, dents, paint chips on the bumpers wheels and frequently overlooked roof should be assessed too.  
Circular inspection overview: Functional equipment include lights signals, air conditioning units alongside windscreen wipers; all claim heated conversations over their proper functioning and require confirmation.
Evidence of condition photographs: Documentation showcases pictures with timestamp allowing verification on claimed dates proving conditions claimed alongside via written submissions of noted terms enhancing accuracy and credibility.
For any discrepancies, bring them to the attention of the rental company staff and make sure these notes are signed by an employee before leaving the lot. 
Getting a staff member’s sign-off on existing damage safeguards you by showing that those issues were present beforehand. This detailed inspection may seem unnecessary when all you want is to start your vacation, but it can save you from unjust damage fees in the future.
3. Bypassing Insurance Options
Would skipping out on extra insurance for a rental car help you cut costs? While it might be possible, it isn’t usually advisable. Assuming that your personal auto insurance policy or credit card offers complete coverage for rentals out of Perth could prove financially disastrous. 
Many personal automobile policies issued abroad do not extend to rented vehicles or include substantial limits (such as no cover for long-term rentals or certain classes of vehicles). 
The same goes for credit card coverage; it usually is limited to short-term rentals and excludes vandalism cover on windows, tyres, undercarriage damage, or one car collisions.’
Prior to bypassing the coverage offered by the rental company, follow these:
Review your current coverage: Reach out to your insurance provider or check with your credit card company for their coverage policies regarding overseas rental cars.
Understand the excess (deductible): Most Australian rentals come with a hefty damage excess. In case of damage or theft, you are liable for that amount unless you purchase a waiver or reduction.
While skipping rental insurance may seem tempting due to potential short term savings, one minor incident might outweigh this decision cost far more than the daily insurance rate. It is either extreme underestimation or overconfidence not having an appropriate cover in place. 
Ideally you would always go for the rental company’s coverage through comprehensive policy that shields you from accident damaging expenses or have proper full protective policy which averts turning vacation into a financially stressful ordeal.
4. Not Reading the Terms and Conditions (The "Fine Print")
What critical aspects should you be aware of in the hiring contract for a vehicle? The answer is: all of them! Errors made skipping through the terms and conditions often come back to haunt people. 
Moreover, unlike standardized contracts, there can be rental-specific idiosyncratic rules from every company. If you are short on time at the kiosk or presume all contracts are uniform, you run the risk of accepting terms that are discordant with your plans or penalty charges that surprise you.  
“Refrain from signing until you read every detail.” These are some important items to review in your rental contract:
Mileage policy: Does your rental come with unlimited mileage, or is there a cap on km/miles as well? You’ll incur additional costs for surpassing capped distance kilometers if there’s an upper limit.  
Fuel policy: Markoff whether policies like full-to-full (return after filling tank completely) or pre-purchase(fuel advance with empty returns) applies to you. Ignoring such policies can result in disproportionate refueling charge fines.
Geographic restrictions: Some companies have boundaries on driving on unsealed (gravel) roads or beyond certain areas. If you intend to go beyond Perth metro to Margaret River or even the outback, be sure it is allowed under your contract.  
Return timing and fees: Be aware of the specific return time noted in your agreement. Many agencies consider you an extra full day if you are a few hours late. Also, take note of their business hours as returning the vehicle after hours may incur additional charges.  
As outlined, reading every term prevents unpleasant surprises such as additional charges or voided insurance due to non-compliance with stipulated conditions. 
While this might not be the most thrilling aspect of renting a vehicle, dedicating ten minutes towards understanding the contract will avoid unnecessary expenses and frustrations. If clarification is needed on any point ask staff, knowing is always better than learning the hard way later on.

5. Returning the Vehicle Later than Scheduled and/or with a Full or Empty Tank

What are the applicable terms for returning your rental vehicle late and/or without refueling? In short, you incur additional charges. One of the more common blunders while renting a car is exceeding the return time limit, which can be quite costly. 
Most rental services in Perth have some form of buffer period; however, surpassing this grace period results in additional costs being incurred either by the hour or per day. 
To illustrate, certain businesses impose a flat daily charge even if the vehicle is returned just two hours late. Furthermore, unnotified after-hours returns will result in complications during check-in that could attract fees.
Another area where customers experience financial loss is routing ignoring fuel policies set in place by businesses. Not adhering the expectation of returning cars full will attract exorbitant fees as listed filling as well as service costs.
Give yourself enough time unequivocally adhering to schedule when planning out refuel locations alongside prompt vehicle return.
Avoiding additional fees is as simple as returning the car on time and fully fueled. These minor details can be planned to save a considerable amount of money, and help prevent disputes regarding billing at the end of the journey.

6. Leaving Important Files or Methods for Payment Behind

A significant number of travelers are shocked when they arrive at a rental counter only to realize they don’t have with them an important document. A driver’s license and a method of payment are extremely essential when hiring a car, and without them it would be hard to proceed with the plans. 
In Australia driving rentals usually require a driver’s licence and demand payment via credit card under the name of the primary driver for the security deposit. International tourists should take note that their foreign licenses would need IDPs unless they are in English or translated officially.
Verify these items one last time before collecting your vehicle: 
Driver's licence: It must be valid in its full form (not including photocopies). Non-English licences must present IDP or certified translation as required.
Credit card: A major credit card is needed for the deposit hold. Debit cards and cash are not accepted.  Make sure your credit card hasn’t expired and has enough available credit for the deposit.  
Age & extra drivers: Show up with any extra drivers who possess valid licenses, so they can be added to the contract.  

For long-term car rentals in Perth, policies may be more stringent and documentation could be re-verified if you extend your hire. To avoid unpleasant surprises such as additional charges at the rental counter, it is advisable to thoroughly read both the booking confirmation email and terms of service beforehand to understand what documents are required. There is nothing worse than being denied a vehicle at the last minute due to a resolvable oversight.
7. Selecting the Incorrect Vehicle

Selecting an inappropriate vehicle for your journeys is another common mistake that people often make. While a compact hatchback might be economical, it won’t suit larger families. Planning to go off-road or into the outback? You’ll need a 4WD, as many standard rental cars cannot access unsealed roads.
If planning on using your own travel itinerary, consider carefully how many passengers you expect and choose the most suitable vehicle type.
